I primarily use python to program a series of low-level networking tools: Client/Servers via TCP, UDP, and SSH, HTML and flask Servers, 
as well as network sniffers to scan and monitor traffic on networks by sending UDP packet datagrams to wait for responses and see what
machines I can talk to, as well as interacting with a variety of different network protocols. I also use python to develop: Encryption/Decryption 
tools, Man in the browser attack programs, mapping web applications, web brute forcing, as well as to develop trojan programs that I can update 
and communicate with on different systems, as well as for SQL injection attacks. I’m learning machine learning with python at the moment, 
and I do also use it to develop fast GUI’s for pentesting tools using PYQT5.
