#The firs thing we need to do is se tup the mian target and Http HEADDERS THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEND OVER TO THE MAIN TARGE
host = "http://localhost:80" #This is going to target our HTTP server on port 80
#YOU CAN CHANGE THIS LINK IF FYOU NEED TO TO QUERY OTHER FORMS OF WEB APPLICAIOTNS

#PUT request 
headers = {}

headers ["GET"] = " / HTTP/1.1" #We need to make a file where the PUT request for the HTTP cleint is being made
headers ["Host"] = "localhost"
headers ["User-Agent"] = "Googlebot" #This identifies the main agent we will idetify ass (VERY CRUCIAL IN THAT WE CAN BYPASS CERTAIN FIELDS MIMIKING ANOTHER END USER AGENT)

#Next we need to generate and establish the main request to the target
connection = urllib.request.Request(host, headers=headers)

#Next we need to read in the response from the mian request
response = urllib.request.urlopen(connection) 
data = str(response.read())

#Now we just need to print out the main request
print(data) #The read function will parse and read through any and all data that's in the request

#We are now gonna save the mian conetents from the conneftion to a file 
connectiodata = open("URLRequest.txt", 'w')
connectiodata.write(data)
connectiodata.close()

#Now it's time to test if the main file is going to be written to the target server
